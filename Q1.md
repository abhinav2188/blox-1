## Question 1 - Call Me Api

There is an API that one must call to get data. The trouble is it will not let you cross the
limit of call - say 15 calls per minute. If you cross the limit, the system penalizes you by one
additional minute of penalty where you can not make any call. Here is how the API looks
like: function string call_me(string input).
Propose a solution by which:
1. You would be able to use the API within the safe limit.
2. What happens if you are supposed to call the API 20 times per minute? Is there
   any way to accomplish this?
3. If you were the API designer, what would you do to implement this behavior?

### Solutioning

1. 
* The question majorly talks about rate limiting an api calls that are not based on user i.e. we need to globally implement rate limiter
* We will be using ratelimiter algoritm called sliding window logs where we maintain timestamp of each request made.
* on each api call we find the number of requests made within 1 min of current timestamp, allow api call if our threshold is not reached

2. if we are supposed to call this api 20 times where only its allowed to call it 15 times.3
